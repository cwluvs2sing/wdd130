      <h1 class="home-title">Welcome to Decorista, a site to help you creatively decorate any space in your home!</h1>
      <p>Have you ever fallen in love with a piece of art or décor and brought it home, only to find yourself completely stumped with what to do with it? Or maybe you put it on a mantel or a bookshelf and it just looked lonely or off-balance? My name is Cheryl and Decorista is my brain child, born from a love of decorating and helping others find joy in their spaces! I can’t even count how many times people have come to my home and asked if I would be willing to provide decorating services. I’ve also been asked to help stage homes for a quick sale. Each time I help, they’re always wowed because all I did was tweak what they already had or maybe add a few simple items. So many homeowners just need a little bit of inspiration and a few tips to transform their space. You’ll be amazed at what a plant, a few books or a tray can do! Decorista will provide you with practical, easy to follow tips to help you fall in love with your home all over again!</p>
