      <h3>Styles</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing that you need to know is your own style! What speaks to you? Do you like distressed and vintage pieces that represent farmhouse style? Do you like classic and clean lines that stand the test of time? Do you love the beach and want to feel like you’re on the coast all the time? Maybe you love it all and want a mixed eclectic space?  It’s important to know your style before you bring any new pieces into your space. So, let’s look at some of the most popular styles below and see what speaks to you.
        
        Farmhouse
        Farmhouse style aims for simplicity, practicality and old charm. It usually consists of light neutral shades of whites, beiges and greys. Some color may be incorporated but it’s usually muted. You’ll see rough-hewn and natural woods, vintage bulbs, tins and coppers, painted and vintage cabinets, soft denims and cottons, and fresh floral arrangements.
        
        Modern
        Modern design came on the scene in the mid 20th century. You’ll see a lot of scandanavian and mid-century pieces in this style. Furniture will have clean lines and smooth surfaces like metal and glass. You won’t see a lot of clutter in modern design so if you don’t like knick knacks, this style may be for you. Most décor you’ll see in modern design is just a simple art piece or mirror on a wall
        
        Coastal
        This is exactly what it sounds like, beach inspired design! Lots of natural light and  breezy fabric are key. Colors are calming and mimic the grasses, sands, ocean and sky. Natural textures like grasses, jute and wicker are used along with painted pieces that look lived in.  You’ll see pieces like blown glass vases, shells and rope used with this style.
        
        Industrial
        Industrial style is usually focused on architecture stripped back to it’s barest bones. The floorplans are usually very open with concrete or old wood floors. You’ll see a lot of old brick walls featured in all their imperfect glory, rustic metal pipes, vintage wood beams and exposed pipes and air ducts. In the furnishings and décor, reclaimed pieces with metal accents, rustic woods and leathers are the favorites. Light is usually simple metal or wood pieces featuring Edison bulbs. Art and décor is usually vintage mixed with modern.
        
        Boho
        Boho, or Bohemian style, screams of travel, culture and earthiness. With boho you’ll see trinkets from around the globe, along with different textures and colors. There are almost no rules as to order here. Mixing styles is key. So Persian rugs, faux furs, globes, cacti, Asian sculptures, native American dream-catchers…you get the picture. It all lends to a very nomadic vibe. Don’t forget the plants!
        
        Eclectic
        Eclectic is a perfect mix of old and new of all different styles and motifs. It brings together many different time periods. You might see Scandinavian furniture mixed with ornate French Renaissance accents. Similar to the boho style, you’ll see a mixture of patterns, textures and colors. A gallery of wall art with ornate gold frames next to sleek black frames,  or even wood frames and featuring natural art prints, retro and classic paintings is a popular eclectic look. When done carefully, it looks beautiful and intentional.

      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <p>
        There are some important rules to decorating and just being aware of these rules and following them will make big differences in your space. I’d like to share with you a few of the easiest rules that you can implement quickly.
        
        Hang art pieces at eye level.
        I’ve seen so much art that is too big or too small for its space. I’ve also seen art that is off center or too high on the wall. Don’t hang artwork centered between the top of the sofa and the ceiling, that is too high. That might be spaced evenly but you don’t want it to look like a floating island on the wall. You want it to be part of your space. The rule of thumb is that the center of the art should be at eye level or 57” off the ground.
        
        Don’t line up your furniture along the walls.
        Another thing that too many people do is line all their sofas and chairs up along the walls of their room, leaving a large empty space in the middle of the room for gymnastic and dancing. Bring your furniture in to make it cozier and more conversational. Anchor it with an area rug!
        
        Use the rule of three.
        Using the rule of three will change things big time. Décor placed on surfaces like shelving, mantles, countertops and tables should be arranged in odd numbers. It’s more appealing and pleasing to the eye. You can also use 5, 7 or 9….odd numbers win here. Following this rule alone will make you look like a pro.
        
        Mix up shapes.
        Don’t always use squares and rectangles. Soft lines can add so much warmth and personality. If you have a square set up in your living room, throw in a round coffee table. Or put a circular mirror above a console table instead. Always make sure there are circular, oval or softer shapes in your room.
        
        Baskets are your friend.
        I’m a fan of baskets. They’re a great addition of texture and warmth and double as a catchall for any space. I have baskets on my game room shelves that hold all the little boxed card games and dice. I have a stair basket to catch items that need to go upstairs. A big basket in the corner of the living room holds cozy blankets. I don’t think you can have enough baskets.
        
        Learn to love plants.
        Plants instantly bring life to a home, give it a calming effect and help purify the air! Studies have even shown that plants can improve mood and mental health. Even if you don’t have a green thumb, there are great plants out there, like the indestructible ZZZ Plant, that you can start with. Seriously, I’ve had this plant for 4 years and only water it once every 3 or 4 months and it stays beautifully green! Get one at your local home improvement store next time you’re out!
        
        These are just a few tips that can make a big difference in your home. Each week I will add more so be sure to follow me on Instagram or facebook!
