      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>There are some important rules to decorating and just being aware of these rules and following them will make big differences in your space. I’d like to share with you a few of the easiest rules that you can implement quickly.</p>

    <div id="rules-container">

      <section class="rules-item-2">
        <h2>1. Hang art pieces at eye level.</h2>
        <p>Don’t hang artwork centered between the top of the sofa and the ceiling, that is too high. That might be spaced evenly but you don’t want it to look like a floating island on the wall. You want it to be part of your space. The rule of thumb is that the center of the art should be at eye level or 57” off the ground.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="rules-item-3">
        <h2>2. Don’t line your furniture along the walls. </h2>
        <p>Another thing that too many people do is line all their sofas and chairs up along the walls of their room, leaving a large empty space in the middle of the room for gymnastic and dancing. Bring your furniture in to make it cozier and more conversational. Anchor it with an area rug!</p>
        </section>
      <section class="rules-item-4">
          <h2>3. Use the rule of three.</h2>
          <p>Using the rule of three will change things big time. Décor placed on surfaces like shelves, mantles, countertops and tables should be arranged in odd numbers. It’s more appealing and pleasing to the eye. Follow this rule alone and you will look like a pro!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="rules-item-5">
        <h2>4. Mix up shapes.</h2>
        <p>Don’t always use squares and rectangles. Soft lines can add so much warmth and personality. If you have a square set up in your living room, throw in a round coffee table. Or put a circular mirror above a console table instead. Always make sure there are circular, oval or softer shapes in your room.</p>

      <section class="rules-item-6">
        <h2>5. Baskets are your friend.</h2>
        <p>I’m a big fan of baskets. They’re a great addition of texture and warmth and double as a catchall for any space. Put a big basket in the corner of the living room to hold blankets, in the game room for card games, or even on your stairs to collect items. I don’t think you can have enough baskets!</p>

      <section class="rules-item-7">
        <h2>6. Learn to love plants.</h2>
        <p>Plants instantly bring life to a home, give it a calming effect and help purify the air! Studies have even shown that plants can improve mood and mental health. Even if you don’t have a green thumb, there are plants out there that I'm convinced you can't kill, like the indestructible ZZZ Plant! These are just a few tips that can make a big difference in your home.</p>
