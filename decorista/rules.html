        <img class="farmhouse-img" src="images/style-farmhouse.png" alt="farmhouse style">
        <h2>Farmhouse</h2>
        <p>Farmhouse style aims for simplicity, practicality and old charm. It usually consists of light neutral shades of whites, beiges and greys. Some color may be incorporated but it’s usually muted. You’ll see rough-hewn and natural woods, vintage bulbs, tins and coppers, painted and vintage cabinets, soft denims and cottons, and fresh floral arrangements.</p>

        <img class="modern-img" src="images/style-modern.png" alt="modern style">
        <h2>Modern</h2>
        <p>Modern design came on the scene in the mid 20th century. You’ll see a lot of scandanavian and mid-century pieces in this style. Furniture will have clean lines and smooth surfaces like metal and glass. You won’t see a lot of clutter in modern design so if you don’t like knick knacks, this style may be for you. Most décor you’ll see in modern design is just a simple art piece or mirror on a wall.</p>

        <img class="coastal-img" src="images/style-coastal.png" alt="coastal style">
        <h2>Coastal</h2>
        <p>This is exactly what it sounds like, beach inspired design! Lots of natural light and breezy fabric are key. Colors are calming and mimic the grasses, sands, ocean and sky. Natural textures like grasses, jute and wicker are used along with painted pieces that look lived in. You’ll see pieces like blown glass vases, shells and rope used with this style.</p>

      <section class="industrial-style">
        <img class="industrial-img" src="images/style-industrial.png" alt="industrial style">
        <h2>Industrial</h2>
        <p>Industrial style is usually focused on architecture stripped back to it’s barest bones. The floorplans are usually very open with concrete or old wood floors. You’ll see a lot of old brick walls featured in all their imperfect glory, rustic metal pipes, vintage wood beams and exposed pipes and air ducts. In the furnishings and décor, reclaimed pieces with metal accents, rustic woods and leathers are the favorites. Light is usually simple metal or wood pieces featuring Edison bulbs. Art and décor is usually vintage mixed with modern.</p>

      <section class="boho-style">
        <img class="boho-img" src="images/style-boho.png" alt="boho style">
        <h2>Boho</h2>
        <p>Boho, or Bohemian style, screams of travel, culture and earthiness. With boho you’ll see trinkets from around the globe, along with different textures and colors. There are almost no rules as to order here. Mixing styles is key. So Persian rugs, faux furs, globes, cacti, Asian sculptures, native American dream-catchers…you get the picture. It all lends to a very nomadic vibe. Don’t forget the plants!</p>

      <section class="eclectic-style">
        <img class="eclectic-img" src="images/style-eclectic.png" alt="eclectic style">
        <h2>Eclectic</h2>
        <p>Eclectic is a perfect mix of old and new of all different styles and motifs. It brings together many different time periods. You might see Scandinavian furniture mixed with ornate French Renaissance accents. Similar to the boho style, you’ll see a mixture of patterns, textures and colors. A gallery of wall art with ornate gold frames next to sleek black frames, or even wood frames and featuring natural art prints, retro and classic paintings is a popular eclectic look. When done carefully, it looks beautiful and intentional.</p>
