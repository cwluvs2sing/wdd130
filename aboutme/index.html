  <h2>Cheryl Wellman</h2>
  <p>Hi everyone, my name is Cheryl and I'm a 45, have been married for 25 years and a mother to 4 incredible children, ages 11, 13, 17 and 20.</p><p>I'm taking this course to see if web development is what I want to do for the rest of my life! I've been a self-taught graphic designer for 25 years and have built some websites with templates and messed with a little bit of code but don't really know html or css that well. I've also started and jumped out of an SEO business, so I understand what needs to be in a web page for high visibility on google. I didn't how fast google changed their algorithms and quickly decided not to keep up with that. I feel like web development is the next step for me but am still contemplating a business degree as well. The python coding course I took last semester was really hard and has me second guessing! Ultimately I would love to be creative and work with a team to develop something outstanding and valuable for clients.</p><p>I love interior design and gardening. I also love to sing and play the piano. I just really love being creative!</p><p>BYU Idaho is ideal because it's less expensive and all online. Even more than that, I love how it incorporates God and the gospel into our learning!</p><p>I've been a member of the church since my mom started taking me at the age of 4. I was married in the temple at 19 and happy with my overall path. Life threw my a curveball 10 years ago when my husband decided to leave the church. He's been atheist since then and so I've taken the kids to church on my own. To say it's been the hardest trial in my life is an understatement, but we're still happily married and I'm stronger in my faith than I've ever been in my life. I've experienced many tender mercies. My very favorite scripture is Mosiah 24:13-15 becuase I've seen this promise fulfilled in my life as I've kept my covenants. I testify of this promise any chance I get with others who are struggling in life.</p>
